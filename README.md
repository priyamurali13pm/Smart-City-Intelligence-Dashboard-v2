# 🏙️ Smart City Intelligence Dashboard

## 📖 Description

The **Smart City Intelligence Dashboard** is an end-to-end, AI-driven platform designed to
monitor, analyze, and forecast critical urban conditions in real time.

This project integrates **Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Time Series Forecasting, and NLP**
to address real-world smart city challenges such as road safety, traffic congestion,
air quality monitoring, crowd management, and citizen grievance analysis.

The system provides an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** that visualizes detections,
predictions, and analytical insights, helping city authorities and decision-makers
take **data-driven actions** to improve urban safety, sustainability, and quality of life.


An end-to-end **AI-powered Smart City platform** built using  
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Time Series Forecasting, NLP, and Cloud Deployment.
